### Lizzy Chen

### A. Briefly describes the app

Built on Andriod Stuido, this application aims to eventually provide musics from record labels and media companies. So far the application has a couple of functions developed as listed below:
1. “Change Username” button that can change the username;
2. “Apply” button that can record and present the username after changing the username;
3. Display of name of the current playing song (not actually playing at this stage)
4. Display of the names of the artists
5. Display of the number of song plays. Note that when the app just starts, the number displayed would be a random number
6. A Play Button. When a user clicks on play, it increases the number of plays displayed by one
7. A Previous Button. When a user clicks on the previous button, it shows a brief message at the bottom of the screen saying “Skipping to previous track”
8. A Next Button. When a user clicks on the previous button, it shows a brief message at the bottom of the screen saying “Skipping to next track”
